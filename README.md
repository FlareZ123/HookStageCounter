# HookStageCounter([中文](/README_zh.md))

`Dead by Daylight`'s **Killers** track hooks stages of **Survivors** in games.

*“Nowadays, They can have a better tunneling!”*

## How to use

* Stage growth: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`

  *"Yes, you did a good job, probably."*
* Stage decline: `Shift+1`, `Shift+2`, `Shift+3`, `Shift+4`

  *"Something must be wrong. Something!"*
* State reset: `0`

  *"Death is Not an Escape."*
* Focus the window to move the window or set the window size.

  *"maybe. This stupid thing should look better."*

## Roadmap & Future Developments

- [ ] Use image recognition for automatic and reset counting(Need to adapt screen resolution and shaders).

  *"Damn it, it's a little difficult. "*
